# Autogenic Automaton

Simulation of autogenesis in an origin-of-life model

The genesis of structure and function from a previously unstructured, high-entropy reaction-diffusion system is modeled in the Autogenic Automaton, providing a simulated account of how self-organizing, self-mending and selection processes are dynamically intertwined. Simulation experiments are described in a paper titled “Exploring Constraint”.
