# Autogenic Automaton

Simulation of autogenesis in an origin-of-life model

The genesis of structure and function from a previously unstructured, high-entropy reaction-diffusion system is modeled in the Autogenic Automaton, providing a simulated account of how self-organizing, self-mending and selection processes are dynamically intertwined. 

Simulation experiments are described in a paper titled “Exploring Constraint” (see https://github.com/asimovinstitute/autogenic-automaton/blob/master/Paper%20-%20Exploring%20Constraint.pdf, also to be found in https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/proceedings-artificial-life-conference-2016)
