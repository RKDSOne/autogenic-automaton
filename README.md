# Autogenic Automaton

Simulation of an autogenic process

The genesis of structure and function from a previously unstructured, high-entropy reaction-diffusion system is modeled in the Autogenic Automaton, providing a simulated account of how self-organizing, self-mending and selection processes are dynamically intertwined. Simulation experiments are described in a paper titled “Exploring Constraint”, currently under review at Artificial Life journal.
